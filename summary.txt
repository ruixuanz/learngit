The key steps to create a repository and push the contents:

Step 1: git add <file>

	# add the files into stage	

Step 2: git commit -m <message>

	# commit to the local repository

Step 3: git remote add origin <SSH>

	# connect to the remote repository

Step 4: git push -u origin master

	# commit all contents to the master fork



Remove a file:

Step 1: git rm <file>

	# remove the file in the repository

Step 2: rm <file>

	# remove the file in the working space

Step 3: git commit -m <remove file>






git reset --hard commit_id: make the pointer HEAD to the version of commit_id
git log: check the commit history
git checkout -- <file>: undo modifications in the working space
git reset HEAD <file>: if the file has already been added to the stage, undo and and use the above command to undo the operations in working space
